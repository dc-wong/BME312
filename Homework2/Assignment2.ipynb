    "Surface electromyography (EMG) is a commonly used measurement to provide insight as to how muscles are working. While they provide measures of voltage on the skin directly above different muscles, they are often used to infer the forces muscles are producing and the resulting net torque across different joints. However, surface EMGs can only be considered relative and not absolute measures since the measures they provide are very sensitive to electrode placement and skin preparation. As a result, the relationship between EMG and joint torque can vary drastically from subject-to-subject and even from day-to-day in any individual. Therefore, any device that wants to infer muscle force or joint torque from EMG measurement would need to be calibrated on a daily basis. To minimize burden on the user, it would be preferable if this type of calibration would be as short as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the included datasets, there are 50 recordings of EMG from 6 muscles and ankle torque in 3 planes. This dataset simulates the kind of data that would be collected during some sort of calibration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 6 muscles are:\n",
    "- Tibialis Anterior (a dorsiflexor and invertor muscle); Lateral Gastrocnemius, Medial Gastrocnemius and Soleus (plantarflexor muscles); and Peroneus Longus and Peroneus Brevis (plantarflexor and evertor muscles).\n",
    "- Torques were measured in the Frontal plane (+x = eversion, -x = inversion); Sagittal plane (+y = dorsiflexion, -y = plantarflexion); and Transverse plane (+z = internal rotation, -z = external rotation). The data can be found in Torques.csv\n",
    "- For each EMG signal 10 features were computed. The data can be found in Features.csv\n",
